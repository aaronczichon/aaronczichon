### Hi there 👋

My name is Aaron 😊   
I'm from Germany 🇩🇪 and lived the last year in Canada 🇨🇦.    
I work 100% remote and if you're curious where I'm located you can check my [/where](https://aaronczichon.de/where) page.

💻 I'm working at [PlanB. GmbH](https://github.com/planbgmbh) as a Senior Javascript Engineer.    
🛠 My focus is on web technologies and mostly Javascript/Typescript, HTML and CSS. Lately I got into Swift and occasionally I do Rust and C#.    
🦜 Just reach out to me and let's have a chat!   
📱 Since August 2022 I'm an [official Ionic Developer Expert (IDE)](https://ionic.io/developer-experts)   
🌏 Want to learn more about me? Check out my [website](https://aaronczichon.de).

Github is lately only pushing AI tools. It would be okay if they would improve and fix the main product. Therefore I started move to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/aaronczichon) a non-profit alternative to Github.
