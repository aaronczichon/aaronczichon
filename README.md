### Hi there 👋

My name is Aaron 😊   
I'm from Germany 🇩🇪 but I live currently in Canada 🇨🇦.    
I work 100% remote and if you're curious where I'm located more specific you can check my [/where](https://aaronczichon.de/where) page.

💻 I'm working at [PlanB. GmbH](https://github.com/planbgmbh) as a Senior Javascript Engineer.    
🛠 My focus is on web technologies and mostly Javascript, HTML and CSS. Lately I got into Rust and occasionally I do C#.   
📦 I worked with all the large and most of the not so large JS frameworks. So feel free to ask something.   
🦜 Just reach me out and let's have a chat!   
📱 Since August 2022 I'm an [official Ionic Developer Expert (IDE)](https://ionic.io/developer-experts)   
🌏 Want to learn more about me? Check out my [website](https://aaronczichon.de).
